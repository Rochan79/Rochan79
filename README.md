- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and concurrent deployment projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Machine Learning, how to perform a sensible EDA of data and how to write production-ready code. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects in and around data science, in Python and R. I would also love to work on maths and statistics projects
